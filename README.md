# CMPE 256 Team 4 Recommender Systems

## Introduction
The abundance of food choices available today can make it difficult for consumers to decide what to eat. To address this problem, food recommendation systems have been developed to help users discover new food items that match their preferences. A food recommendation system predicts a user's preference for a food item based on their past interactions with similar items.

This project focuses on building a food recommendation system that predicts ratings based on user interactions with food items. The dataset used in this project contains user reviews and ratings for different food items, recipe steps, and description and date of interaction. Various models and techniques are being explored, including GloVe, TF-IDF, BM25, neural nets, and Faiss, to calculate similarities between different food items and generate predictions for new food items.

The goal of this project is to build a robust recommendation system that can help users discover new food items they are likely to enjoy, while also providing valuable insights into user preferences and behavior. Such a system can benefit food companies and retailers by better understanding their customers' preferences and providing personalized recommendations. Overall, this project has the potential to enhance the user experience in the food industry and provide more satisfying and personalized recommendations for users.
